# NoNetherFog

## This clientside mod removes the fog in the Nether.

## It also adds a zoom key, so you can see further now the fog is not in the way.
 
This mod needs FORGE to work.
  
The **zoom key** is **unassigned** by default to prevent overlapping. You can **increase/decrease** the zoom with the **mouse scroll wheel**.
